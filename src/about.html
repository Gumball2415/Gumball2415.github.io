							this is my website.<br />
							<p>
								a lot of stylistic choices were influenced by my early days of HTMLDev and old
								websites in general, it had this very charming yet simplistic design that was
								limited mainly by bandwidth and browser feature set at the time. this was also
								inspired by <a href="https://heckscaper.com">emma essex's webpage</a>, which was my main inspiration for this style.
							</p>
							<p>
								the backbone of the design was mostly from old code that i found lying about in
								my hard drive for a school project. after refactoring and touching up the jank,
								it becomes what you see now.

								hello, i'm persune. (pɜːsuːneɪ) i'm an aspiring video editor / chiptunist / musician /
								hardware-hobbyist / software-developer. more hobbies might come under my
								toolbelt as time passes by. in my free time, i usually work on my projects:
							</p>
							<p>
								the name "persune" literally came to me in a dream. the words flashed in neon
								green, "who is Persune?". it was some kind of premonition i guess, because a week
								later, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHd64tV50AM">this video</a>
								released and the imagery was exactly like the one in the dream.
							</p>
							<p>
								i maintain
								<a href="https://github.com/Dn-Programming-Core-Management/Dn-FamiTracker">Dn-Famitracker</a>,
								a 3rd-derivative fork of FamiTracker,
								which contains emulation improvements, QoL improvements, and more.
							</p>
							<p>
								i also make <a href="https://github.com/Gumball2415/Chiptune-Python-Scripts">scripts</a>
								from time to time whenever i need them, for different
								purposes.
							</p>
							<p>
								i make <a href="https://github.com/Gumball2415/nes-scribbles">little NES programs</a>
								to learn 2A03 assembly, and i make chiptune
								music for the NES/Famicom.
							</p>
							<p>
								i make Famicom cartridge PCBs just for learning, aiming to create an
								<a href="https://github.com/Gumball2415/S.C.A.R.F.-Expansion-Audio-Interfacer">intricate expansion audio addresser</a>
								for my chiptune music.
							</p>
							<p>
								sometimes, i knit very long scarves, with the aim of each new one to get more
								complex in design.
							</p>
							<p>
								my "finished" music goes through my record label "
								<a href="https://sattnstar.bandcamp.com">Sattelite &amp Stardust Recordings</a>
								", but other than that, i usually post my stuff on my
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7bhDiocmKLrzKXXwIHT9nQ">youtube</a>,
								<a href="https://twitter.com/Gumball2415">twitter</a>, or
								<a href="https://github.com/Gumball2415">github</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								i find it desirable to create <i>something</i>, but after some time passes, it gets
								quite boring, hence the shifting hobbies.
